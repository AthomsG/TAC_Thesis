# Reinforcement Learning with discrete TAC

Repository for Discrete Tsallis Actor-Critic (Discrete TAC) model implementation for solving reinforcement learning tasks. This model is built using PyTorch and is designed to effectively learn policies that maximize Î±-Tsallis regularized expected returns in various discrete environments.
